# Gen AI for Data Insights

### 1. To read the CSV file to a data frame and a generate statistical description of the data set, provide the generative AI model with the following prompt.

```bash
Write a python code to perform the following actions: 

1. Import a data set from a CSV file, The headers for the data set must be in the first row of the CSV file.

2. Generate the statistical description of all the features used in the data set. Include "object" data types as well.
```
### 2. Next, you decided that you need to see the distribution of various attributes against the target attribute. The target attribute, in this case, is Price. Different forms of visualizations are for different types of attributes. Attributes with continuous values use regression plots, and the attributes with categorical values use box plots.

### You can provide the generative AI model with a list of continuous values and another list of categorical values within a single prompt and ask the model to create a code that generates these plots.

### The attributes with continuous values are CPU_frequency, Screen_Size_inch and Weight_pounds.
The attributes with categorical values are Category, GPU, OS, CPU_core, RAM_GB and Storage_GB_SSD.

Create the following prompt:

```bash
Write a Python code to perform the following actions:

1. Create regression plots for the attributes "CPU_frequency", "Screen_Size_inch" and "Weight_pounds" against "Price".

2. Create box plots for the attributes "Category", "GPU", "OS", "CPU_core", "RAM_GB" and "Storage_GB_SSD" against the attribute "Price".
