The company needs to understand customer purchasing behaviors over the last year to tailor their upcoming holiday campaigns. Traditionally, this would involve complex SQL queries, data wrangling in Python, and perhaps building visual dashboards to interpret the results including analyzing spreadsheets, creating charts, and maybe even some statistical analysisâ€”tasks that require considerable time and expertise.\n","\n","With the integration of Langchain and LLMs, you can simply ask, \"Show me a visualization of monthly sales trends by product category,\" or \"Generate a heatmap of customer activity by region.\" The system would use the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` to process the CSV data, and then dynamically generate visualizations such as line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps in response to these queries. This not only speeds up the data analysis process but also allows team members who may not be tech-savvy to engage directly with the data and make informed decisions quickly. This approach fosters a more collaborative environment and ensures that strategic decisions are backed by real-time data insights, visually represented for easy comprehension.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/V_7__WU_jHJ1lOpTeSLxTQ/chat%20with%20data.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"indexing\"/>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c8d095b-b0ea-44be-8085-8da061651a36","metadata":{},"source":["In this lab, you will learn how to seamlessly integrate data visualization into your conversational data analysis using Langchain and LLMs. Starting with CSV file data, you will use the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` to build an interactive agent that not only understands and responds to your queries but also translates data responses into visual formats. You will explore how to dynamically generate charts, graphs, and heatmaps directly in response to natural language questions. This capability will enable you to visualize trends, compare figures, and spot patterns immediately, making your data analysis workflow both efficient and visually engaging. By the end of this project, you will have the skills to create a data conversational agent that acts as both analyst and visualizer, bringing data to life through dialogue.\n","\n","In this lab we are going to use Llama 3 LLM hosted on the IBM watsonx.ai platform.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0f783e4a-8580-479a-9124-3d65a913986e","metadata":{},"source":["---------\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f566aa95-c62b-4488-8383-82748b58c80a","metadata":{},"source":["## __Table of contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Overview\">Overview</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Importing-required-libraries\">Importing required libraries</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Data-set\">Data set</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Load-the-data-set\">Load the data set</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Load-LLM\">Load LLM</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Talk-to-your-data\">Talk to your data</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Plot-your-data-with-natural-language\">Plot your data with natural language</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","</ol>\n","\n","<a href=\"#Exercises\">Exercises</a>\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercise-1---Relationship-between-parental-education-level-and-student-grades\">Exercise 1.
