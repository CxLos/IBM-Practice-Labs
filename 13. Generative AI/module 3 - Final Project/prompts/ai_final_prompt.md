# Final Project: Generative AI for Data Science

## 1. Import Dataset

You can begin by using the Generative AI model to create a python script that can load the dataset to a pandas dataframe. The dataset file already has the headers in the first row.

### Write the prompt to generate the said code and test it in the JupyterLite environment. For verification of appropriate loading, include a step for printing the first 5 values of the loaded dataframe.

Write a Python code that can perform the following tasks.
1. Read the CSV file, located on a given file path, into a pandas data frame, assuming that the first row of the file can be used as the headers for the data.
2. Print the first 5 rows of the dataframe to verify correct loading.

```bash

```
