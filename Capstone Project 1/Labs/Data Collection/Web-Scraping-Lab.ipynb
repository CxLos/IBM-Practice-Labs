A programming language is created to solve a specific problem. A language which is good for task A may not be able to properly handle task B. Comparing programming language is never easy. What we can do, however, is find which is popular in the industry.</p>\\n<p>There are many ways to find the popularity of a programming languages. Counting the number of google searchs for each language is a simple way to find the popularity. GitHub and StackOverflow also can give some good pointers.</p>\\n<p>Salary surveys are a way to find out the programmings languages that are most in demand in the industry. Below table is the result of one such survey.
