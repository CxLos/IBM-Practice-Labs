# Data Science Capstone Project

## Objective

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

In the data set, there are several different cases where the booster did not land successfully. Sometimes a landing was attempted but failed due to an accident; for example, <code>True Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a specific region of the ocean while <code>False Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. <code>True RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a ground pad <code>False RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.<code>True ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully landed on  a drone ship <code>False ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship.
